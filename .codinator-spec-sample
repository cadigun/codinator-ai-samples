    - For variables and methods, stick to using camelCase, like localVariable or computeTotal.
    - When naming classes and interfaces, go for PascalCase, such as CustomerService or PaymentGateway.
    - Keep constants in uppercase with underscores separating words, for example, MAX_SIZE or DEFAULT_TIMEOUT.
    - Instead of return codes, use exceptions to handle errors, and try to catch specific exceptions rather than the generic Exception.
    - Please make sure to document the purpose, parameters, and return values of each method for clarity.
    - When working with channels and goroutines, always close the channels and make sure the goroutines finish executing.
    - Comment your code clearly, starting each comment with the name of the element you're describing.
    - Use the built-in testing package for writing tests and name your test files with the _test.go suffix to follow conventions.
    - It's a good habit to end each file with a newline.
